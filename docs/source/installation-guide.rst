Installation Guide
==================

QUICK has been compiled and tested on x86, ARM CPU and Nvidia, AMD GPU hardware.
The compilation of the GPU enabled ERI code can take a significant amount of time (several minutes) - be patient, the compiler is working hard to generate lightning fast code for you.

Compatible Compilers and Hardware
---------------------------------

In general QUICK works well with a range of GNU or Intel compilers, Intel MKL, Open MPI, Intel MPI, different CUDA and ROCM versions. 
We have specifically tested |QUICK_VERSION| with following compilers under the Linux operating system.

 1. GNU/9.3.0; ROCM/5.1, 5.2, 5.3; OpenMPI/4.0.3, 4.1.4 : No issue detected so far.

|QUICK_VERSION| CUDA version has been tested on the following GPU cards: A100, RTX3080Ti, RTX2080Ti, RTX8000, RTX6000, RTX2080, T4, V100, Titan V, P100, M40, GTX1080, K80 and K40.

|QUICK_VERSION| HIP version has been tested on the following GPU cards: MI100, MI210, MI250. As of QUICK-23.03, the performance on MI210 and MI250 cards is not optimized but the code runs properly. 

**Note:** We recommend that the CUDA, CUDA-MPI, HIP, HIP-MPI versions be executed only on dedicated GPU cards where no other tasks are being run. Performance is better on datacenter GPUs than on consumer GPUs. 
For CUDA-MPI and HIP-MPI versions, we also recommend that only one CPU core (MPI task) is used per GPU; this can be done by setting the number of processes (*e.g.*, in the *mpirun* command) equal to the number of GPUs.

We have also tested |QUICK_VERSION| on Intel based Macbooks with following software stack (compiler installed via Macports):

 1. macOS 11.7.3; GNU/10.4.0, 11.3.0, 12.2.0; OpenMPI 4.1.4 : No issue detected so far.
 2. macOS 13.2; GNU 12.2.0, OpenMPI 4.1.4 : No issue detected so far.


Installation
------------

QUICK installation requires at least CMake/3.9.0 installed in the target machine. To install QUICK using CMake, one must first create a build  directory. After installation you can safely delete this build directory if you want to save disk space. Assuming the root folder of the repository is ``QUICK_HOME``, you can make the build directory like this:

.. code-block:: none

	cd ${QUICK_HOME}
	mkdir builddir

CUDA version
^^^^^^^^^^^^

Assuming you have created a directory named *builddir* in the ``QUICK_HOME`` directory and you want to install QUICK into directory ``QUICK_INSTALL``, use GNU compiler tool chain, and want to compile for Nvidia Volta microarchitecture, all QUICK versions can be configured and built as follows.

.. code-block:: none

	cd ${QUICK_HOME}/builddir
	cmake .. -DCOMPILER=GNU -DMPI=TRUE -DCUDA=TRUE -DQUICK_USER_ARCH=volta \
          -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=${QUICK_INSTALL}
	make
	make install

Where ``-DMPI`` and ``-DCUDA`` flags enable compiling MPI parallel and CUDA serial versions. Specifying both flags simultaneously will trigger compilation of the MPI-CUDA multi-GPU version. The serial version is compiled by default.

If you want to compile CUDA code for different microarchitectures, you can specify these as a string with space separation, e.g. ``-DQUICK_USER_ARCH='volta turing'`` to compile for Volta and Turing architectures.

If the microarchitecture is not specified, then QUICK will be compiled for multiple architectures based on your CUDA toolkit version. This will lead to a very time consuming compilation but to maximum compatibility of the ``quick.cuda`` and ``quick.cuda.MPI`` executables with different types of GPUs.

HIP version
^^^^^^^^^^^^

Assuming you have created a directory named *builddir* in the ``QUICK_HOME`` directory and you want to install QUICK into directory ``QUICK_INSTALL``, use GNU compiler tool chain, and want to compile for AMD gfx908 microarchitecture, all QUICK versions can be configured and built as follows.

.. code-block:: none

        cd ${QUICK_HOME}/builddir
        cmake .. -DCOMPILER=GNU -DMPI=TRUE -DHIP=TRUE -DQUICK_USER_ARCH=gfx90a \
          -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=${QUICK_INSTALL} -DHIP_TOOLKIT_ROOT_DIR=${ROCM_PATH} \
          -DMAGMA=TRUE -DMAGMA_ROOT=${MAGMA_PATH} 
        make
        make install

Where ``-DMPI`` and ``-DHIP`` flags enable compiling MPI parallel and HIP serial versions. Specifying both flags simultaneously will trigger compilation of the MPI-HIP multi-GPU version. The serial version is compiled by default. Path to ROCM installation can be specified using ``-DHIP_TOOLKIT_ROOT_DIR`` but this is optional. Flags ``-DMAGMA`` and ``-DMAGMA_ROOT`` are used to enable Magma library support for matrix diagonalization and specify Magma installation directory. The use of Magma is optional but highly recommended since the diagonalization is performed on host by default. 

If the microarchitecture is not specified (i.e. in the absence of ``-DQUICK_USER_ARCH``), QUICK will be compiled for gfx908 architecture. As of QUICK-23.03, specifying multiple microarchitectures for HIP version (e.g. ``-DQUICK_USER_ARCH=gfx908 gfx90a``) is not supported. This means that the resulting ``quick.hip`` and ``quick.hip.MPI`` executables will only run on a single AMD GPU architecture.    


A full list of available flags and their definitions can be found `here <cmake-options.html>`_. 

Testing
-------

Once you have installed QUICK, you can add the location of the executables to your path and set relevant environment variables by sourcing (source executes the commands in a file) the ``quick.rc`` script. This must be done again every time a new terminal session is opened:

.. code-block:: none

		source ${QUICK_INSTALL}/quick.rc

The build system makes use of a shell script (``runtest``, located in ``${QUICK_HOME}/tools`` but will be copied to the installation directory ``QUICK_INSTALL``) for testing QUICK. Below we describe the standard procedure to carry out tests; but if you are interested, see `here <runtest-options.html>`_ for more information on the ``runtest`` script.

Short tests can be run using the ``runtest`` shell script found inside the install directory. 

.. code-block:: none

	source $(QUICK_INSTALL)/quick.rc
	cd ${QUICK_INSTALL}
	./runtest

Similarly, robust testing can be performed as follows. 

.. code-block:: none

	cd ${QUICK_INSTALL}
	./runtest --full

You may now try some hands-on tutorials to learn how to use QUICK `here <hands-on-tutorials.html>`_.

Uninstallation and Cleaning
---------------------------

Simply delete contents inside build and install directories and / or delete the build and install directories.

Running QUICK in a Container
----------------------------
For users that are familiar with software containers, QUICK is also made available as a Docker container which can be run in Docker, Singularity and Kubernetes.
The current version of the QUICK container is compiled for x86_64/amd64 CPUs and NVIDIA GPUs and runs serial, MPI, CUDA and CUDA-MPI versions of QUICK.

**Note:** For CUDA-enabled versions of QUICK, the container requires the host system have the necessary GPU drivers installed.

**Note:** For MPI-enabled versions of QUICK, the container comes with an MPI runtime which can run on multiple CPUs of a single node. Multi-node execution has not been tested.

The container is published on the GitHub container registry and can be found in the packages section of the GitHub repository: `<https://github.com/merzlab/QUICK/>`_.
You may want to review the available versions, but for the examples below we will use this image: ghcr.io/merzlab/quick:23.08a-mpi-cuda-12.0.1.

The following examples have been generalized, so you should be familiar with the system you plan to run the container on. 
Many HPC resources will have additional steps that might be required, for example loading modules needed to run Docker or Singularity. 

Below is the file contents for water.in used in the examples below:

.. code-block:: none

	HF BASIS=cc-pVDZ CUTOFF=1.0d-10 DENSERMS=1.0d-6 ENERGY

	O              -0.06756756   -0.31531531    0.00000000 |
	H               0.89243244   -0.31531531    0.00000000 |
	H              -0.38802215    0.58962052    0.00000000 |

Docker
^^^^^^
To run the container with Docker, begin by pulling the image:

.. code-block:: none

	docker image pull ghcr.io/merzlab/quick:23.08a-mpi-cuda-12.0.1

Once the image has been pulled, you can run the image and mount your current directory in the container at /data:

.. code-block:: none

	docker run --rm -it -v $(pwd):/data ghcr.io/merzlab/quick:23.08a-mpi-cuda-12.0.1 /bin/bash

Change your directory to /data:

.. code-block:: none

	cd /data

You can then run quick, quick.MPI, quick.cuda or quick.cuda.MPI on an input file:

.. code-block:: none

	quick water.in

When you are done, you can exit the container with the exit command:

.. code-block:: none

	exit

Your output file(s) will be left on your local directory:

.. code-block:: none

	ls
	--
	water.in  water.out

Singularity
^^^^^^^^^^^
To run the container with Singularity, begin by pulling the image:

.. code-block:: none

	singularity pull docker://ghcr.io/merzlab/quick:23.08a-mpi-cuda-12.0.1

This will pull the image and convert the Docker container to a Singularity container such as quick_23.08a-cuda-12.0.1.sif.

Once the image has been pulled and converted, you can run a shell from your current directory:

.. code-block:: none

	singularity shell --nv quick_23.08a-cuda-12.0.1.sif

**Note**: Singularity requires the --nv flag for the CUDA-enabled versions of QUICK

You can then run quick, quick.MPI, quick.cuda or quick.cuda.MPI on an input file:

.. code-block:: none

	quick water.in

When you are done, you can exit the container with the exit command:

.. code-block:: none

	exit

Your output file(s) will be left on your local directory:

.. code-block:: none

	ls
	--
	water.in  water.out

Kubernetes
^^^^^^^^^^
Since the container is published as a Docker container, it can also be run on Kubernetes-based systems.

Below is an example Kubernetes manifest file, saved as "quick.yaml", for a job:

.. code-block:: yaml

    apiVersion: batch/v1
    kind: Job
    metadata:
      name: quick-qm
    spec:
      template:
        spec:
          containers:
          - name: quick
            image: ghcr.io/merzlab/quick:23.08a-mpi-cuda-12.0.1
            command: ["sleep", "infinity"]
            resources:
              limits:
                cpu: "4"
                memory: "16Gi"
                nvidia.com/gpu: "4"
              requests:
                cpu: "4"
                memory: "16Gi"
                nvidia.com/gpu: "4"
          restartPolicy: Never

**Note**: This manifest should be updated to conform to the resources available on the nodes in your Kubernetes cluster. 
For example, this manifest assumes the availability of nodes with 4 NVIDIA GPUs.

Once you have appropriately modified the manifest for your cluster configuration, you can schedule the job:

.. code-block:: none

	kubectl apply -f quick.yaml

You can check the availability of the pod running the QUICK container like so:

.. code-block:: none

	kubectl get pods --watch
	---
	NAME             READY   STATUS              RESTARTS   AGE
	quick-qm-wpwns   0/1     ContainerCreating   0          7s
	quick-qm-wpwns   1/1     Running             0          68s


Once the pod is running and ready shows (1/1), stop the watch command with ^C (ctrl + c).

**Note**: The pod name "quick-qm-wpwns" will be different for you. Make sure to update the pod name in the following commands.

You can now execute a terminal into the container:

.. code-block:: none

	kubectl exec -it quick-qm-wpwns -- /bin/bash

You can then copy data into the container via your preffered method. 
For simplicity in this example we will use the kubectl cp command from a second terminal on our local machine:

.. code-block:: none

	kubectl cp water.in quick-qm-wpwns:/root/water.in

Returning to the terminal attached to the container, we can change directory to /root to find our file:

.. code-block:: none

	cd /root
	ls
	---
	water.in

You can then run quick, quick.MPI, quick.cuda or quick.cuda.MPI on an input file:

.. code-block:: none

	quick water.in

When you are done, you can exit the container with the exit command:

.. code-block:: none

	exit

You can then copy the output data back to your local machine:

.. code-block:: none

	kubectl cp quick-qm-wpwns:/root/water.out ./water.out

You can then verify the transfer succeeded:

.. code-block:: none

	ls
	---
	water.out

Once you have transferred your data, you should end the job:

.. code-block:: none

	kubectl delete -f quick.yaml
